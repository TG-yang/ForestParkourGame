# ForestParkourGame
using Unity 3D to develop a parkour game, and I achieve a function about loading the map dynamically.
This game will help you grasp an important skill which is loading the map dynamically. As we all known, There is a confit between game resource and phone memory.
And this skill can help you solve this problem. When you control the person in a certain scene, the system will only loading next scene and save the last scene. And other game scene will be deleted.
This approach can not only using a little phone memory, but also making sure that you can not see out of the scene.
